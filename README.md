## Introduction
This repository is the Pytorch implementation of Dual-Teacher++, accepted by the Special Issue on Annotation-Efficient Deep Learning for Medical Imaging in IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging.

The conference version of our work for MICCAI 2020, i.e., [Dual-Teacher](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-59710-8_41), is in another repository.
